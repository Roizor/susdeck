# Susdeck has moved!
Susdeck has moved to a new repo to make the URL a bit more memorable, as well for other Susdeck related projects.  
You can see the new repo at [Susdeck/Susdeck](https://github.com/Susdeck/Susdeck)

# Susdeck

Susdeck is love. Susdeck is life. Susdeck is not a Stream Deck.
Susdeck is a macro pad meant to model a Stream Deck with macro capabilities.  
Susdeck does not play sounds, it is meant to control your computer with minimal ease like a Stream Deck.  
You'll need to set up your own soundboard, keybinds, icons (if wanted) if you want a setup like mine.  
For the soundboard, I recommend [Soundux](https://github.com/Soundux/Soundux).  
So far, Susdeck only officially supports iOS.

## What does it look like?
Here's a preview of the UI:

## How do I use Susdeck?
Clone the repo, then change `Settings.js.default` to only have it's extension `.js`.  
Next, modify the settings however you want, you can add authentication, a password, and a message for when somebody tries to login to your Susdeck.  
Now, for the fun part. Run `npm i` and then `npm run start`.  
Now your computer is hosting a server on port 3000. Get any iOS device and go to `yourlocalip:3000` in Safari.  
Now, add the app to your home screen by pressing the share button.  
Next, open the app on your device. It will be full screen.  
**Susdeck is best viewed in landscape/horizontal mode.**  
There are preloaded keys, for example `Shooting` will press Alt+F24 - it is meant to be a keybind in a soundboard.  

## But I have more than *9* macros, how can I fix this?
The `sounds.js` file includes an example for multiple pages. An example of a new page with 1 sound would be 
```js
[
        {
            name: 'What The Dog Doin?',
            keys: [
                'alt',
                'f4'
            ],
            // *Common sense!* As a warning do not use alt+f4 as an actual keybind. It will close your running program! This is just an example of a new page.
            icon: 'susdeck.png'
        }
    ]
```
and to add this as it's own page it's as simple as finding the closing `]`, adding a comma to it `],` and pasting this in and repeating the macros as needed!

## How do I make my own sounds/macros?
Susdeck processes keys at the front-end, and it uses robotjs to press them on your computer.  
It is very easy to add your own macros/sounds.  
All you need to do is edit `app/sounds.js` to your liking.  
**Icons are not required for any macro/sound!**  

## Tested Devices
Susdeck has not had many devices tested on it. Information on how to contribute to testing will be added later. For now, these are the officially supported devices.

## Closing Notes
Do not mind the occasional reference to 'Onyx', that is a super not secret codename for Susdeck.
